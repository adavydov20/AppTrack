Google Fit: Activity Tracking,Health & Fitness,3.6692219,649289.0,"100,000,000+",0,"Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Google Fit will also help you:

TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH
Get instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.

MONITOR YOUR GOALS
See your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.

MAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT
If you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.

CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES
Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.

CHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE

Splits Training in 30 Days,Health & Fitness,4.8458242,339830.0,"50,000,000+",0,"Splits Training is designed for all levels to <b>get full splits</b> step by step, even if you are a beginner. The mixing of static and dynamic splits helps you <b>improve flexibility</b> effectively and achieve results faster than you think. With about <b>10 min a day</b>, you‚Äôll get closer and closer to the floor!

Productive stretches for splits in 30 days are suitable for men and women, adults and kids. You can customize your splits training based on your own preferences, <b>no equipment</b> needed.

Whether you want to do a full split for dance, ballet, gymnastics or martial arts, this training will help you get there.

<b>Why splits</b>?
Splits have been proven to prevent injuries, increase muscle strength, relieve muscle stiffness and give you better circulation.

<b>Improve your flexibility & balance</b>
Flexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.

<b>Loosen your hip flexors</b>
Due to sitting at a desk all day, most people have extremely tight hip flexors, which can cause pain, especially in your lower back. Splits open up these areas to relieve your muscle tension.

<b>Deeply stretch your legs</b>
When doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time. Doctors will recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you‚Äôre doing activities such as running or biking.

<b>Boost your circulation</b>
Splits lengthen your muscles and improve your circulation by increasing blood flow to your muscles.

Please get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits. Splits need time; your muscles need time to stretch, recover and adapt to the new demands. Be patient, and stick to it; you‚Äôll soon see progress.

<b>Features</b>
- Splits for all levels, splits for beginners, splits for men, splits for women, splits for kids
- Step-by-step directions on how to do the splits for all levels
- Effective formula to help achieve results fast
- Splits in 30 days
- Customize your own training plan
- Easy-to-follow instruction, animation and video guide
- Record your progress automatically
- Stretches for splits target all muscles you need to become super flexible
